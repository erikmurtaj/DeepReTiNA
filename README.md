DeepReTiNA stands for Real-Time Anomaly Detection IDS with a Deep and comprehensive study on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 Dataset. 

The main contribution is the creation of a classifier model that has been integrated in the CICFlowMeter tool, originally developed by A. H. Lashkari ([CICFlowmeter-V4.0](https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter)) to detect Real-Time cyber-attacks and act as a simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
